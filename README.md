This is the repository with the code for a [Unity Editor UI scripting workshop](https://www.prgda.net/event-list/unity-intro-to-editor-ui-scripting) I created and delivered with the help of the Puerto Rico Game Developer's Association ([PRGDA](www.prgda.net)).

The workshop went over:
* Tools Development as a career
* Custom Unity Editors
* Custom Editor Windows
* Additional resources for learning

It was a lot of fun to make this content, and I hope that it can inspire you into looking at Tools Development as a career choice as well!
